### Course Catalog Description
Students should have elementary algebra skills and be familiar with both elementary word processing and Windows file management techniques prior to enrolling in this class. The course will introduce the fundamental techniques and syntax for understanding, designing, constructing, debugging, and testing object-oriented programs using the Python programming language. The structured programming basics of process, selection and iteration will be covered as well as primitive and complex data typing, methods, parameters and input/output. Fundamental object-oriented concepts of classes, methods, abstraction, encapsulation and inheritance will also be introduced. Students will be required to complete computer-based assignments inside/outside of class.
### Course Prerequisites
None
### Course General Education Outcomes
•	Critical Thinking

Any student engaging in academic dishonesty will receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported to the Dean’s office.  If you are unsure if something qualifies as academic dishonesty, please ask.  Under no circumstances may Chegg.com be used, do not post questions there, do not cite answers posted there. Any use of chegg.com or similar websites will be considered academic misconduct.  
Per the OCC Handbook:  
It is college policy that no student shall engage in behavior which, in the judgment of the instructor of the class, may be construed as academic dishonesty. This may include, but is not limited to, plagiarism, presenting another individual’s ideas, data, words, images, or other products without giving credit to the originator, or other forms of academic dishonesty, such as the acquisition (without permission) of tests or other academic materials and/or distribution of the same. This includes students who aid and abet, as well as those who attempt such behavior.

#### N Mark (Grade) Non-Attendant Policy  
This mark is awarded to students who, though registered, never attended class, did not officially drop, and (if an online or hybrid class) have no gradable work. Marks of "N" do not satisfy prerequisites and are non-transferable. This mark is not used in the calculation of GPA, but it may affect eligibility for financial aid. Instructors confirm non-attendance by the "N" Mark Report Date (found in MyOCC for each section) and then submit their "N" marks to the institution. Students who have received an "N" mark will not be permitted to enter the class, nor will the student be able to drop the class. After the "N" mark has been submitted, a change of grade will not be accepted for the student. For more information refer to OCC's Grading Policy.
